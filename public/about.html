<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Software engineer, c++, system programming, multithreading</h2>
<p>I am a Software Engineer with experience in firmware development, system optimization, 
    and embedded software engineering. <br /><br>
    My role involves developing and optimizing Flash memory access firmware, 
    including Flash Copy and Flash Move implementations, 
    using thread-based architectures for efficient memory operations. <br>
    I worked closely with subsystem owners to refactor code, eliminate cyclic dependencies, 
    and enhance system efficiency. Additionally, I ensure strict compliance with AUTOSAR standards, 
    conduct unit testing for high code coverage, and collaborate with firmware, hardware, and 
    validation teams to improve software safety and reliability. <br><br>
    My contributions have led to reduced execution time, improved system responsiveness, 
    and enhanced maintainability of embedded systems.
